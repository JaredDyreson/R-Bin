# power analysis

- determine the prob for both hyp (No software, p)
- get a dist. (under null and alt)
	- test stat (pop proportion and or the number X <- easier because we just count )
	- always binom
	- null and alt will hae same nbut different p
	- peak likely (mode)
	- mean expected
	- lower tail is the left side

80% means it is worth our time to investigate based on a fixed sample size
	- if it does not fit in this value, then we will see if we need a larger sample
