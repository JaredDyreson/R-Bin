## Conditional Probability Examples

### Example 1

In a lecture class of 150 students, 110 students are freshmen, 50 own a dog, and 25 are freshmen who own a dog. 
Suppose a student is selected at random.

### Tree Diagram Version

#### Root

- Freshman ($\frac{110}{150}$)
	- Own dog : $\frac{25}{110}$ [Freshman AND own dog = ($\frac{110}{150} \times \frac{25}{110} = \frac{1}{6}$)]

	- No dog : $\frac{85}{110}$ [Freshman AND no dog = ($\frac{110}{150} \times \frac{85}{110} = \frac{17}{30}$)]

- Not Freshman ($\frac{40}{150}$)

	- Own dog : $\frac{25}{40}$ [Not freshman AND own a dog = ($\frac{40}{150} \times \frac{25}{40} = \frac{1}{6}$)]

	- No dog : $\frac{15}{40}$ [Not freshman AND not own a dog = ($\frac{40}{150} \times \frac{15}{40} = \frac{1}{10}$)]

a. What is the probability of being a freshman, given that the student owns a dog?

	- $P(Freshman|Dog) = \frac{P(Freshman\, AND\, Dog)}{P(Dog)} = \frac{\frac{25}{150}}{\frac{25}{150} + \frac{25}{150}} = \frac{25}{50} = \frac{1}{2}$

b. What is the probability of owning a dog, given that the student is a freshman?

	- $P(Dog|Freshman) = \frac{P(Dog\, AND\, Freshman)}{P(Freshman)} = \frac{\frac{25}{100}}{\frac{110}{150}} = \frac{25}{110} = \frac{5}{22}$

- P(Freshman & Dog) = P(Freshman) P(Dog|Freshman)
- P(Freshman & Dog) = P(Freshman) P(Dog) $\leftarrow$ \hl{Independence}

## Power Analysis Examples

### Example 1

It is believed that about 10% of the population is left-handed. However, China has claimed that less than one
percent of its students are left-handed. Suppose we are interested in evaluating whether there is something
special about Chinese people, or whether the Chinese government is lying. Suppose further that we have
devised a scientifically perfect test to measure a personâ€™s dominant hand. Would a random sample of 50
Chinese students be large enough to detect a population difference of 10% vs. 1%?

\hl{We want low $\alpha$ and high power}

- H\textsubscript{0} : p = 0.1 [Null]
- H\textsubscript{1} : p = 0.01 [Alternate]
- `N` : 50
- $\alpha$: 0.05
	- If $\alpha$ is not given, please assume $\alpha = 0.05$
- Define p = proportion of left handed students
- For midterm one, define X = number of (successes) [left-handed students in our sample.]
- Decision rule:
	- Critical region: $X \le x$
	- If X is in critical region, accept H\textsubscript{0}, else accept H\textsubscript{1}.
	- Only problem is we \underline{do not} know what `x` is.
	- Defining our critical region to be $X \le 5$
		- Under the null hypothesis H\textsubscript{0}, $X \sim B(50, 0.1)$
			- P($X \le 5 | p = 0.1$) = 0.616
			- P(Type 1 Error) = 0.616
		- Under the alternative hypothesis H\textsubscript{1}, $X \sim B(50, 0.01)$
			- $\beta = P(X > 5|p = 0.01) = 0$
			- Power $= P(X \le 5 | p = 0.01) = 1$
	- Defining our critical region to be $X \le 1$
		- When p = 0.1
			- 3.4% false positive
			- 96.6% true negative
			- $\alpha = 0.034$
		- When p = 0.01
			- 91.1% true positive
			- 8.9% false negative
			- Power = 0.911
			- $\beta= 0.089$

### Example 2


\hl{Is this sample large enough to detect something $\rightarrow$ power rule!!!!!!!}

\hl{We want low $\alpha$ and high power}

- H\textsubscript{0} : p = 0.26 [Null]
- H\textsubscript{1} : p = 0.52 [Alternate]
- `N` : 14
- $\alpha$: 0.05
	- If $\alpha$ is not given, please assume $\alpha = 0.05$
- Define p = % of patients progression free after 6 months

Using `R`:

- Critical region is X > 6 or $X \ge 6$

- `lower.tail = TRUE` includes $\le$
- `lower.tail = FALSE` includes >

- When P = 0.26
	- 4.7% false positive
	- 95.3% true negative
	- $\alpha = 0.047$
- When P = 0.52
	- 66.2% true positive
	- 33.8% false negative
	- Power = 0.662
	- $\beta = 0.338$
