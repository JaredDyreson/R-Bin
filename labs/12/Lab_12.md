# Lab 12

1. Write the null hypothesis for this test of independence.
- \textbf{Someone's personality is strictly agnostic from their major, contributing in no way, shape or form}
2. If the sample size assumptions are met (all expected counts > 5), what would be the sampling distribution of your test statistic (i.e., what is the type of distribution and the degrees of freedom)?
- \textbf{The sampling distribution of my test statistic would be $\chi^2$ and the degrees of freedom is $(4-1)(3-1) = 6$}
3. If the null hypothesis is true, calculate the \underline{expected} number of analysts who are Computer Science majors. If your number is not an integer, round it to at least one decimal place.
- \textbf{$\frac{20}{48} \times 7 = 2.916666667$, where 20 out of the 48 students are computer science majors and there are 7 total diplomats in the class}
4. If the null hypothesis is true, calculate the \underline{Pearson residual} and \underline{contribution} to the chi-squared statistic for analysts who are Computer Science majors.
- \textbf{$\frac{O - E}{\sqrt{E}} = \frac{5 - 2.92}{\sqrt{2.92}} = 1.217$}
5. To obtain the p-value, can we use the sampling distribution from Question #2, or do we have to simulate a sampling distribution? Explain your reasoning. (HINT: look at your answer to Question #3)

```r
majors <- read.csv("~/Downloads/majors.csv")
majors.table <- xtabs(~ Major + Personality.Type, data = majors)
```

- \textbf{We would need to simulate because the result from question 3 is 2.9 which is less than 5. We need to proceed with method two.}

6. Copy the RStudio output below.

```r
chisq.test(majors.table, simulate.p.value = TRUE)
```
```
Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated
p-value (based on 2000 replicates)

data:  majors.table
X-squared = 7.1918, df = NA, p-value = 0.3088
```

7. What is the value of the chi-square test statistic as computed by R?
- \textbf{The value of $\chi^2$ is 7.1918}
8. What is the p-value for this test?
- \textbf{The p-value is 0.3088}
9. Using a 5% significance level, can you conclude that peopleâ€™s personality type affects their choice of major?
- \textbf{Since the p-value greatly exceeds the cut off of 5 percent, we can fail reject the null hypothesis.}
10. Do you believe that your answer (from Question #9) applies to all students at Cal State Fullerton? (HINT: Think about the sample we used and the way we collected the data)
- \textbf{This will most likely not represent the population because we only had a population consisting of natural science majors rather than a broader distribution of majors.}
